        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <p>
            Tic-tac-toe, also known as XO or X and O, is a pencil-and-paper game played by two players. 
            The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their symbols (usually X or O) into the grid. 
            The goal is to get three of the same symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            Playing tic-tac-toe is quite simple. Players take turns placing their symbols (usually X or O) into an empty cell on the 3x3 grid.
            The player who first manages to get three of the same symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, is the winner. 
            If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is considered a draw.
